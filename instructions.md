## Soroco Front-end Application Development Challenge

In this challenge, you will create a small application using either React or Angular.

We have provided skeletons for the application in both React and Angular. Please choose one and complete your solution in the appropriate directory. More explicit instructions for the challenge can be found in the READMEs in both the react and angular directories.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure that you remove `node_modules` from your solution before re-uploading to HackerRank.

Indicate in `notes.txt` which framework you chose.

When re-uploading to HackerRank, please upload this entire `Frontend Evaluation` folder as a zip - not just the \angular or \react folder you completed your solution in.
